name: add-a-board
description: Add a new S-100 board (or CPU board) to the simulator — the wiring checklist that surrounds the board class itself: registry, CMake, boardCategory, tests, the generated reference, the two docs no test guards, and the board's own docs/boards/*.md. Use when adding, emulating or implementing a board, card or controller, or when a board compiles and you need to know what else it must touch before it ships.

# Add a board

**The tutorial is `docs/devguide/adding-a-board.md`** — a worked board (the `examples/boards/lamp/`
card) from `type()` through properties and tests. Read §1–5 for the shape; this skill is the
part that bites *after* the board compiles. Everything here fails somewhere that does not point
back at the board you just wrote.

Plan in plan mode first (`work-task`), and prove the board is wanted: check the GitHub issues —
a declined board is recorded there with its reason.

## Before you write a line

- **Model it from a period source.** `reference/*.md` if we have one, and if we do not, the scan
  goes through the `pdf-to-reference` skill first. Never from another emulator's source.
- **Reuse the chip.** `src/chips/` already holds the 6850, 8251, 8253, 8259A, 2651, MSM5832,
  WD17xx, TMS5501 and more. A card is usually a port decode and a strap file wrapped around a
  chip that exists — the MSM5832's header literally says "the next card with one gets this for
  free", and the RTC-100 took it up unchanged.
- **Read the relevant `DESIGN.md` section.** Most surprises here are deliberate.

## Quick anatomy (all in `src/core/board.h`)

`type()` · `decodes()` (**pure and combinational** — the bus caches it) · `read()`/`write()` ·
`properties()` (the whole config layer; **no setter = read-only**, and CONFIG SAVE skips it) ·
`units()`/`unitStream()` · `connect()`/`disconnect()` · `ioMap()` (documentation, never decode) ·
`reset()`/`power()` · `pump()` (**the only place a board touches the host** — never in a bus
cycle) · `serialize()`/`deserialize()`.

**The base address is a `port` property, not a constructor argument.** Validate the shape the
card's address decode really had (even-only, multiple of 4, a 16-port block) and say why in the
error string.

**Interrupts.** `irqJumperProperty("interrupt", …, irq_)` buys the whole `none | int | vi0..vi7`
vocabulary, tab completion and `SHOW BUS IRQ` — *if the card really has a VI connector*. A card
that vectors itself instead (jams its own `RST`/`CALL` on acknowledge) claims the `Cycle::IntAck`
cycle in `decodes()`/`read()` and should not offer VI straps it never had. Either way, override
`assertsInt()`/`assertsVi()` and **call `intChanged()` wherever the pending flag moves** — a
needless call costs a virtual call, a missing one hangs the guest forever.

**Time is wall time.** A board's oscillator is its own crystal, not the CPU's: schedule off
`clock_->tStatesPer(rate)`, cancel and re-arm like `mits-88virtc.cpp`. Do not leave a deadline
queued when the feature is strapped off — `Clock::queued()` is one of the things the run loop
reads to decide a `HLT` has finished, so an idle card must let the machine stand down.

## The wiring — every one of these, or it does not ship

1. **`CMakeLists.txt`** — the `.cpp` into `altair_core`, and the test `.cpp` into `altair_tests`.
2. **`src/boards/registry.cpp`** — the include, the `{"type", "one-line summary", "one-paragraph description"}` row
   (the summary must fit the `SHOW BOARDS` column — `test_cli` checks 78 columns),
   and the factory line.
3. **`tools/gen-reference.cpp` → `boardCategory()`** — **an uncategorized board is a hard error**
   that reds all three CI legs, and the failure names a doc target, not your board.
4. **The endpoint resolver, in BOTH composition roots** — `src/main.cpp` *and* `tests/main.cpp` —
   if the board has a line. Only `main.cpp` and every test that `CONNECT`s it gets a null
   resolver and fails somewhere unhelpful.
5. **Path as written.** Look through `resolvePath()`; **remember the spec the user typed**. Store
   the resolved path and `CONFIG SAVE` rebases it, then the next load rebases it again.
6. **`tests/test_<board>.cpp`**, plus its `void test_<board>();` in `tests/test.h` and its row in
   `tests/main.cpp`'s table.
7. **`docs/boards/<vendor>-<board>.md`** from `docs/boards/_TEMPLATE.md`. **Limitations** and
   **Quirks** are the load-bearing sections: they are where you answer "what did I not actually
   implement?"
8. **`docs/manual/boards.md`** — the summary-table row *and* a prose section. **No test guards
   this**; it once drifted nine boards behind.
9. **`docs/changelog/changelog.md`** — a line under `Unreleased`. Also unguarded.
10. **`cmake --build build --target docs-reference`**, then commit the regenerated
    `docs/manual/ref/*.md`. A ctest byte-diffs them. **Edit the emitter, never the `.md`.**
11. **A sample machine** is a TOML in `machines/` (`base = "default"`), if the board deserves
    one — embedded by `cmake/embed_machines.cmake`. Optional; a board is usable via `BOARDS ADD`.
12. **`reference/README.md` and `docs/sources.md`** — if the board was modeled from a scan, its
    rows stop saying "not emulated" and name the board.

## Testing

Drive **real bus cycles** (`m.bus.ioWrite` / `ioRead`), not the board's methods, so the test
exercises the decode too. Where the manual shipped a driver, **the driver is the oracle** — a
manual's prose and its own listings disagree more often than you would think, and the listings
ran on the hardware.

Cover: the port map and that moving the base moves all of it; every status/control bit; reset
and power (and what deliberately survives them); the interrupt, including that the acknowledge
does what the card really does; snapshot/restore round-trip; and each property's validation.

```sh
cmake -B build -DWERROR=on && cmake --build build -j   # CI's gate, on all three toolchains
./build/altair_tests <board>                           # the suite you added
ctest --test-dir build -LE slow                        # registry + generated docs are cross-cutting
```

Read the `100% tests passed out of N` line — the absence of the word "error" is not a pass.

## Finish

Prove it in the running program, not only in a unit test: `BOARDS ADD <type> <id>`, `SHOW <id>`,
`SET`, `CONFIG SAVE` round-trip, and exercise the ports (`IN`/`OUT` at the monitor, or a guest
program driven over `--mcp` — never a hand-rolled expect script).

Then stop for the maintainer's review (`work-task`), and ship with `ship-change`.
