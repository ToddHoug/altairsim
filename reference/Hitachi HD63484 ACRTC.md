# Hitachi HD63484 Advanced CRT Controller (ACRTC) — Datasheet

Source: [HD63484.pdf](#) — Hitachi *HD63484 ACRTC Advanced CRT Controller* datasheet, the
47-page section (pages 213–259) of a Hitachi microcomputer data book. This is the **primary
trusted source** for `src/chips/hd63484.{h,cpp}`; the board that carries the chip is
`docs/boards/cadzilla.md`. Two companions do the rest: the Hitachi *HD63484 ACRTC
Application Note* (#U90, April 1986, bitsavers) — its §7 gives the reset state (Table 7-1)
and the initialization sequence — and
[`Hitachi HD63484 ACRTC User's Manual.md`](Hitachi%20HD63484%20ACRTC%20User%27s%20Manual.md),
the **primary source for semantics**: the 8-bit MPU-mode byte sequencing this datasheet only
names, the FIFO/status rules, every register field's meaning, and a worked example for each
of the 38 commands. See `docs/sources.md` for the sourcing decision that also admits MAME's
`hd63484.cpp` as the *structural* basis of the model.

*Converted from a 47-page scanned PDF (source pages 213–259) via OCR/transcription. Diagrams (block diagrams, timing diagrams, pinouts, waveform figures) are described in words rather than reproduced graphically. Per-page footers (the HITACHI wordmark and Hitachi America address/phone line) have been removed; page numbers are retained via the "(source page NNN)" markers.*

*Revision note: Figure 5's register bit-field tables (pages 222–225), Table 1's DN field (page 226), and Table 4's command opcode table (page 232) were re-scanned and corrected after an initial pass approximated several bit-field boundaries instead of measuring them. The corrections were independently verified by pixel-measuring the divider lines in the source page images against the 16-bit ruler grid. See the "Re-scanned and corrected" notes inline at each affected table.*

# Advanced CRT Controller (ACRTC)

*(source page 213)*

The advanced CRT controller (ACRTC) CMOS VLSI microcomputer peripheral device can display both graphics and characters on raster-scan displays. It is a new generation CRT controller based on bitmapped technology. It executes high-level commands, like Line, Ellipse, Paint, Pattern, and Copy, issued by the MPU in screen X-Y coordinates, and performs the address translation necessary to draw into frame memory. It can draw in up to 64k colors, on three split screens and an independent window, and perform area clipping and hitting.

The ACRTC controls a CRT in one of three modes: character only, graphics only, and multiplexed character/graphics modes. Therefore, the ACRTC has many applications, from character-only displays to large full-graphics systems.

The ACRTC reduces CPU software overhead and enhances system throughput.

### Block Diagrams

**ACRTC Functions**

The ACRTC consists of 5 major functional blocks (figure 1). They operate in parallel to achieve maximum performance.

**MPU Interface:** The MPU interface interfaces asynchronously with the host MPU. Its functions include programmable interrupts handling, and DMA handshaking control.

**CRT Interface:** The CRT interface manages the frame buffer bus and the CRT timing input and output control signals. It also selects display refresh or drawing address outputs.

---

## HD63484

*(source page 217)*

**Drawing Processor:** The drawing processor interprets commands and command parameters issued by the host bus (MPU and/or DMAC) and performs drawing operations on the frame buffer memory. It executes ACRTC drawing algorithms and converts logical X-Y addresses to physical frame buffer addresses.

It communicates with the host bus via separate 16-byte read and write FIFOs.

**Display Processor:** The display processor manages frame buffer refresh addressing based on the user-specified display screen organization. It combines and displays as many as 4 independent screen segments (3 horizontal split screens and 1 window) using an internal high-speed address calculation unit. It controls display refresh outputs in graphic (physical frame buffer address) or character (physical refresh memory address + row address) modes.

**Timing Processor:** The timing processor generates the CRT synchronization signals and signals used internally by the ACRTC.

**Registers:** The ACRTC registers that are visible to software are partitioned in the same way. They reside in the internal processor appropriate to their function. The registers in the display and timing processors are loaded with the basic display parameters during system initialization. During operation, the host communicates primarily with the ACRTC's drawing processor via the on-chip FIFOs.

**High-Speed (= 9.8 MHz) Version of ACRTC**

To keep up with the demand for improvements in the quality and resolution of CRT monitors, Hitachi has introduced a 9.8 MHz version of the HD63484 (ACRTC).

It can be used for:
1. High-resolution displays such as in office workstations, business personal computers, and CAD/CAM displays.
2. Applications requiring faster drawing than the current ACRTC with an 8-MHz 2CLK operation frequency.

**High-Resolution Display**

As shown in figure A, the 9.8-MHz allows the following configurations for a 4-bit/pixel system:
1. CRT monitor with 1024 x 808 dots, +8 DA or +4 SA
2. CRT monitor from 800 x 480 to 960 x 720 dots, +4 DA

**Figure A. ACRTC Operation Frequency and Supportable CRT Display Range** — A chart plotting CRT resolution/dot clock (vertical axis: 840×400, 640×400 (24 MHz), 800×480 (33 MHz), 960×720 (38 MHz), 1024×808 (68 MHz), 1280×1024 (109 MHz)) against ACRTC operation mode (horizontal axis: +8 SA, +8 DA/+4 SA, -4 DA), with diagonal boundary lines for 4 MHz, 6 MHz, 8 MHz, and 9.8 MHz clock rates and a shaded region labeled "4 bits/pixel" showing the supportable range extended by the 9.8 MHz clock. Note: ACRTC operation mode — +4, +8 = Address increment mode; SA = Single Access mode; DA = Dual access mode.

**High-Speed Drawing Support**

The ACRTC drawing speed depends on its operation frequency. Consequently it takes less time to draw with a 9.8-MHz clock than with an 8-MHz clock. Figure B compares drawing capabilities of the 9.8-MHz ACRTC and the 8-MHz ACRTC.

**Figure B. Drawing Capability Comparison between 9.8-MHz and 8-MHz ACRTCs.**

(a) Short vector drawing (50 dots/vector) — bar chart, k vectors/sec.: 8 MHz = 40, 9.8 MHz = 49.

(b) Block transfer of 1k x 1k dots — bar chart, M dots/sec.: 8 MHz = 1.7, 9.8 MHz = 2.1.

Note: Figure B shows the ideal drawing speed where the ACRTC is assumed to perform only drawing.

**Figure 1. ACRTC Block Diagram** — Block diagram showing five major functional blocks inside the ACRTC. Left side inputs: RES̄ (into DMA Control Unit/Interrupt Control Unit), DREQ̄/DACK̄/DONĒ (DMA Control Unit), IRQ̄ (Interrupt Control Unit), D₀-D₁₅ (16-bit, into MPU Interface), CS̄/RS/R/W̄/DTACK̄ (MPU Interface). The MPU Interface block feeds Register Address and Data buses to the Drawing Processor, Display Processor, and Timing Processor blocks. The Drawing Processor outputs Drawing Address (20 bits) and Drawing Data (16 bits) and a Draw Enable/Write signal to the CRT Interface. The Display Processor outputs Display Address (20 bits), Raster Address (5 bits), CHR, and CCUD to the CRT Interface, and receives GCUD. The Timing Processor outputs HSYNC, VSYNC, EXSYNC, DISP, MCLK, AS, 2CLK to the CRT Interface. The CRT Interface block outputs DRAW̄, MRD̄, MAD₀-MAD₁₅ (16-bit), MA₁₆/RA₀-MA₁₉/RA₃ (4-bit), RA₄, CHR, LPSTB, CUD̄1/CUD̄2 (2-bit), HSYNC̄, VSYNC̄, EXSYNC̄, DISP̄1/DISP̄2 (2-bit), MCYC, AS̄, 2CLK. Power pins Vcc/Vss (2,3,2,5 grouping) enter at the bottom below the MPU Interface block.

### System Configuration

Current CRT controllers provide a single bus interface to the frame buffer that must be shared with the host MPU. However, refreshing large frame buffers, and accessing the frame buffer for drawing operations can quickly saturate the shared bus.

As shown in figure 2, the ACRTC uses separate host MPU and frame buffer interfaces. This allows the ACRTC full access to the frame buffer for display refresh and drawing operations and minimizes the ACRTC's use of the MPU system bus. A related benefit is that a large frame buffer (2 Mbyte for each ACRTC) can be used, even if the host MPU has a smaller address space or segment size restriction.

The ACRTC can use an external DMA controller. A DMA controller increases system throughput when many commands, parameters, and data must be transferred to the ACRTC. Advanced DMAC features, such as the HD68450 "chaining" modes can be used to develop powerful graphics system architectures.

However, more cost-sensitive or less performance-sensitive applications do not require a DMAC. The interface to the ACRTC can be handled under MPU software control.

While both ACRTC bus interfaces (host MPU and frame buffer) are 16 bits wide, the ACRTC also offers an 8-bit MPU mode for easy connection to popular 8-bit busses.

**Figure 2. System Configuration** — Block diagram: MPU (8/16b), System Memory, and DMAC each connect via shared Address, Data, and Control buses to the ACRTC. Signals into the ACRTC from that bus: RES̄, IRQ̄, D₀-D₁₅, DTACK̄, CS̄, RS, R/W̄, DREQ̄, DACK̄, DONĒ, 2CLK, Vcc/Vss. From the ACRTC to the frame buffer (Max. 2 MB): MA₁₆-MA₁₉, AS̄ (through a latch "L"), MRD̄, MAD₀-MAD₁₅. The frame buffer feeds a Dot Shifter, which drives the CRT. The ACRTC also outputs DISP1,2, CUD1,2, LPSTB, EXSYNC̄, VSYNC̄, HSYNC̄ to the Dot Shifter/CRT section, producing the Video Signal to the CRT monitor.

### Programming Model

**Address Space**

The ACRTC allows the host to issue commands in logical X-Y coordinates. The ACRTC converts these physical linear word addresses with bit field offsets in the frame buffer. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the logical X-Y screen address and the frame buffer memory, which is organized as sequential 16-bit words. The host may specify logical pixels of 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 physical bits in the frame buffer. The system in figure 3 uses 4-bit logical pixels, allowing 16 colors or tones to be selected.

Up to four logical screens (upper, base, lower, and window) are mapped onto the ACRTC physical address space. The host specifies a logical screen physical start address, logical screen physical memory width (memory words per raster), logical pixel physical memory width (bit per pixel), and the logical origin physical address. Then the ACRTC converts logical pixel X-Y addresses issued by the host MPU or the ACRTC drawing processor to physical frame buffer addresses. The ACRTC also performs bit extraction and masking to map logical pixel operations (for example, 4 bits), to 16-bit word frame buffer addresses.

**Registers**

The ACRTC has over 200 bytes of accessible registers (figures 4, 5 and table 1). They are organized as hardware access, direct access, and FIFO access.

**Hardware Access:** The ACRTC is connected to the host MPU as a standard memory-mapped peripheral that occupies two word locations of the host's address space. The RS (register select) pin selects one of these two locations. When RS = 0 (low), read operations access the status register, and write operations access the address register.

The status register summarizes the ACRTC state. It monitors the overall state of the ACRTC for the host MPU.

When the MPU wants to access a direct access register, it puts the register's address

**Figure 3. Logical/Physical Addressing** — Diagram with three sections. Left, "Physical Addressing (Frame Buffer)": a vertical memory column labeled bit 0 to bit 15, showing "1 pixel data" spanning several bits near the top, a bracket labeled "MW" (memory width) marking a run of rows, an "SAD" (screen address) marker partway down pointing to a row, and a shaded cell further down. Middle, "Logical Addressing": four stacked parallelogram planes (representing up to four logical screens), each with its own X-Y axes, an "Origin" point, a sample point "(x,y)", and width "MW"; diagonal lines connect corresponding bit-field rows in the physical addressing column to positions in these logical planes. Right, "Display Screen": a rectangle with Y axis (vertical) and X axis (horizontal), an "SAD" marker at the top-left, an "Origin" point, and a sample point "(x,y)" shown via dashed projection lines from the logical addressing planes.

into the ACRTC address register.

**Direct Access:** The MPU accesses the direct access registers by first loading the register address into the address register. Then, when the MPU accesses the ACRTC with RS = 1 (high), the chosen register is accessed.

The FIFO entry register enables the MPU to access FIFO access registers using the ACRTC read and write FIFOs.

The command control register controls overall ACRTC operations, such as aborting or pausing commands, defining DMA protocols, and enabling/disabling interrupt sources.

The operation mode register defines basic parameters of ACRTC operation, such as frame buffer access mode, display or drawing priority, cursor and display timing skew factors, and raster scan mode.

The display control register independently enables and disables the four ACRTC logical address screens (upper, base, lower, and window). It also contains 8 user-defined video attribute bits.

The timing control RAM registers define ACRTC timing, including timing specifications for CRT control signals (HSYNC̄, VSYNC̄, etc), logical display screen size and display period, and blink period.

The display control RAM contains registers which define logical screen display parameters, such as start address, raster address, and memory width. It also includes the cursor(s) definition, zoom factor, and lightpen registers.

**FIFO Access:** For high-performance drawing, key drawing processor registers are coupled to the host MPU via the ACRTC's 16-byte read and write FIFOs.

ACRTC commands are sent from the MPU via the write FIFO to the command register. As the ACRTC completes a command, the next command is automaticaly fetched from the write FIFO and put into the command register.

The pattern RAM defines drawing and painting patterns. It is accessed with the ACRTC's Read Pattern RAM (RPTN) and Write Pattern RAM (WPTN) register access commands.

The drawing parameter registers define detailed parameters of the drawing process, such as color data, area control (hitting/clipping), and pattern RAM pointers. The drawing parameter registers are accessed using the ACRTC's Read Parameter Register (RPR) and Write Parameter Register (WPR) commands.

**Figure 4. Programming Model** — Diagram of the ACRTC's internal register organization, split into four groupings:

Left column, labeled **Control Register** (8-bit, bit 7 to bit 0 headers shown above the top three): Address Register, Status Register, FIFO Entry (dashed box, shown as a pass-through to/from the Write FIFO and Read FIFO on the right), Command Control Register, Operation Mode Register, Display Control Register, then a bracketed group of timing/control-RAM entries: Raster Counter, Horizontal Sync., Horizontal Display, Vertical Sync., Vertical Display, Split Screen Width, Blink Control, Horizontal Window Display, Vertical Window Display, Graphic Cursor; then a second bracketed group: Split Screen 0 Control (Upper Screen), Split Screen 1 Control (Base Screen), Split Screen 2 Control (Lower Screen), Split Screen 3 Control (Window Screen), Block Cursor, Cursor Definition, Zoom Factor, Light Pen Address.

Right side, top (16-bit, bit 15 to bit 0 headers): Write FIFO and Read FIFO boxes, connected (dashed arrows) to/from the FIFO Entry register; below them, a Command Register box that exchanges data bidirectionally with both FIFOs.

Below that, **Pattern RAM**: a 16 x 16 memory block (16 words x 16 bits).

Below that, labeled **Drawing Parameter Register**: Color 0, Color 1, Color Comparison, Edge Color, Mask, Pattern RAM Control, Area Definition, Read/Write Pointer, Drawing Pointer, Current Pointer.

### Figure 5. Hardware Access and Direct Access Registers

Each register below is shown as a 16-bit word split into Data High (bits 15-8) and Data Low (bits 7-0), per the source diagram's column header. Field widths are transcribed from the diagram's box proportions; a few wide multi-bit fields (marked *) are corroborated against resolution/timing figures stated elsewhere in this datasheet — see the note under each.

**Re-scanned and corrected (this page and the three that follow, through page 225):** an earlier pass approximated several register boxes' internal field splits without measuring them, since most rows here don't repeat the bit-position ruler printed above (only the header row has one). Field boundaries below were re-derived by measuring the pixel x-position of each internal divider line against that 16-bit ruler and mapping to the nearest bit boundary, carrying the same grid down the page (and across pages 223-225, whose box proportions match this page's). Address Register, Status Register, FIFO Entry, CCR, OMR, DCR, RCR, HDR, and VSR were already correct and are unchanged; HSR and VDR below needed correction.

### Display Functions

**Logical Display Screens**

The ACRTC allows the frame buffer to be divided into four separate logical screens (table 2, figure 6).

In the simplest case, only the base screen parameters must be defined. Other screens may be selectively enabled, disabled, and blanked under software control.

The background screens (upper, base, and lower) split the screen into three horizontal partitions whose positions are fully programmable. A typical application might use the base screen for the bulk of user interaction, using the lower screen for a "status line(s)" and the upper screen for "pulldown menus".

The window screen is unique, since the ACRTC usually gives it higher priority than the background screens. Thus, when the window, whose size and position is completely programmable, overlaps a background screen, the window is displayed. The exception is in the ACRTC superimposed mode, in which the window has the same priority as the background screens. In this mode, the window and background screens are "superimposed" on the display.

### Table 2. Logical Screen

| Screen Number | Screen Name | Screen Group |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Upper screen | Background screens |
| 1 | Base screen | |
| 2 | Low screen | |
| 3 | Window screen | |

**Figure 6. Screen Combination Examples** — Four example screen layouts:

1. Upper/Base/Lower stacked vertically on the left (Upper on top, Base in the middle, Lower at bottom), with a separate Window pane to the right spanning the Base row's height.
2. A large Base screen with a smaller Window overlapping its upper-right area.
3. Upper, Base, Lower, and Window stacked vertically in that order (four full-width horizontal bands).
4. Upper screen on top, Base screen below it with a Window overlapping the base screen's right portion, and a Lower screen band at the bottom.

## HD63484

*(source page 228)*

**Frame Memory Setup**

The ACRTC can have two independent frame memories, a 2-Mbyte frame buffer and a 128-kbyte refresh memory. The CHR output controls which memory is accessed.

Frame memory width is defined by setting up the memory width register (MWR). The horizontal width is independently defined by the horizontal display register (HDR). The memory area can therefore be specified bigger than the display area (figure 7).

Horizontal display control registers are set in units of memory cycles. Vertical display control registers are set in units of rasters.

Note that display width of registers marked with an asterisk (*) in figure 9 is:

(Display width) = (Register value) + 1 memory cycles

**Figure 7. Frame Memory and Display Screen Area** — Diagram of a large outer rectangle representing the full frame memory, spanned horizontally by "Memory Width" (marked with arrows at the top). A "Start Address" label points to the top-left corner of a smaller inner rectangle labeled "Display Screen Area", which is inset from the top-left of the memory area (offset shown by a small notch at its corner). The inner rectangle's horizontal extent is dimensioned below as "Horizontal Display Width", and its vertical extent is dimensioned at the right as "Vertical Display Width".

## HD63484

**Display Control**

Figure 8 shows the relation between the frame memory and display screens. Each screen has its own memory width, vertical display width, and character/graphic attribution. These specifications are set by the control registers.

**Figure 8. Frame Memory and Display Screens** — Diagram with two memory address columns on the left and their mapped display images on the right:

Top-left: "Refresh Memory (Character)", address range $0000 to $FFFF, split into two regions. The upper region (start address SA0) maps to a frame-memory image of width MW0 containing a dashed box labeled "File Name: MOS". The lower region (start address SA2) maps to a frame-memory image of width MW2 containing a dashed box with two lines of text: "Left : Layout" and "Right : Symbol".

Bottom-left: "Frame Buffer (Graphic)", address range $00000 to $FFFFF, also split into two regions. The upper region (start address SA1) maps to a graphic image of width MW1 containing a small drawn symbol/component icon. The lower region (start address SA3) maps to a graphic image of width MW3 containing a drawn schematic symbol (a logic-gate-like shape).

Right side: these four sources are combined (via arrows) into one composite display, shown as a box with "File Name: MOS" at the top, the component icon (from MW1/SA1) below it, and to its right the schematic symbol (from MW3/SA3), and at the bottom two lines "Left : Layout" and "Right : Symbol" (from MW2/SA2) — illustrating how character text and graphic screens are superimposed into a single displayed image.

**Figure 9. Display Screen Specification** — A combined horizontal-timing / vertical-layout diagram.

Top: an HSYNC̄ waveform (a pulse going low then high) with a series of bracketed horizontal timing intervals measured from the sync edge: HSW (the sync pulse width itself), HDS* (horizontal display start), HWS* (horizontal window start), HC* (total horizontal cycle, spanning the full width), HWW* (horizontal window width), and HDW* (horizontal display width, spanning from HDS to the end of the display area). Intervals marked with an asterisk follow the "(Display width) = (Register value) + 1 memory cycles" rule noted on the previous page.

Below: a large rectangle representing the "Display Screen Period", vertically divided into horizontal bands from top to bottom: (Upper), (Base), (Window) [drawn as a smaller box overlapping/inset within the (Base) band and repeated as a second (Base) band beneath it], and (Lower). To the right of this rectangle, vertical bracket labels mark corresponding vertical timing intervals top to bottom: VDS (vertical display start), VWS (vertical window start), SP0, SP1 (bracketing VWW, vertical window width), SP2, all together spanning VC (vertical cycle, the full height), with VSW (vertical sync width) marked as a separate short interval below the main rectangle. VSYNC̄ is marked at the top-right as the vertical sync reference edge.

### Commands

The ACRTC has 38 commands classified into three groups (tables 3, 4):

- Register access
- Data transfer
- Graphic drawing

Five register access commands give the host MPU access to drawing processor drawing parameter registers and the pattern RAM.

Ten data transfer commands move data between the host system memory and the frame buffer, or within the frame buffer.

Twenty-three graphic drawing commands cause the ACRTC to draw. Parameters for these commands are specified using logical X-Y addressing.

All commands, parameters, and data are trasnferred via the ACRTC read and write FIFOs.

Assuming the ACRTC has been properly initialized, the MPU must perform two steps to make the ACRTC draw:

1. First the MPU must specify drawing parameters that define the details associated with the drawing. For example, to draw a figure or paint an area, the MPU must specify the drawing or painting pattern by initializing the ACRTC pattern RAM and related pointers. If clipping or hitting control are desired, the MPU must specify the area to be monitored during drawing by initilizing the area definition registers. Other drawing parameters include color, edge definition, etc.

2. After the drawing parameters have been specified, the MPU issues a drawing command and any required command parameters, such as the CRCL (circle) command with a radius parameter.

The ACRTC then performs the specified drawing operation by reading, modifying, and rewriting the contents of the frame buffer.

### Table 4. Command Operation Codes and Parameters

**Re-scanned and corrected.** The source page prints each command's Operation Code as a row of 0/1 digits interspersed with named multi-bit field labels (AREA, COL, OPM, RN, PRA, MM, S, DSD, SL, SD, C, E), but does not print a bit-position ruler above the codes, and several digits sit close enough together that a plain read undercounts or misplaces trailing zeros. This version was re-derived by measuring the pixel position and width of every digit/label glyph on the page (each opcode word is 16 bits wide), which caught dropped/misaligned bits in the first transcription and fixed the layout so every row's bit sequence lines up under the same 15→0 ruler below.

Named-field bit widths aren't printed explicitly anywhere on this page; they were inferred from the one constraint that's certain — every Operation Code is exactly 16 bits — checked across every row that uses each field: **AREA**=3 bits, **COL**=2 bits, **OPM**=3 bits (corroborated by the note on the previous page that OPM's value ranges "000–011" and "100–111", i.e. a 3-bit field), **RN**=5 bits, **PRA**=4 bits, **MM**=2 bits, **C**=1 bit, **E**=1 bit. **S** and **DSD** together span 3 bits, and **SL** and **SD** together span 4 bits, but the split between each pair isn't separately determinable from this page, so they're shown as a combined span.

**Program Transfer**

For program transfer, the MPU specifies the FIFO entry address and then writes commands/parameters to the write FIFO under program control (RS = high, R/W̄, CS̄ = low). The MPU writes are normally synchronized with FIFO status by software polling or interrupt.

**Software Polling:** WFR, WFE interrupts are disabled.

1. MPU program checks the SR (status register) for write FIFO ready flag (WFR) = 1, then writes 1 command/parameter word.
2. MPU program checks the SR (status register) for write FIFO empty flag (WFE) = 1, then writes 1 to 8 command/parameter words.

**Interrupt Driven:** WFR, WFE interrupts are enabled.

1. MPU WFR interrupt service routine writes 1 command/parameter word.
2. MPU WFE interrupt service routine writes 1 to 8 command/parameter words.

**Register Access Commands:** When writing register access commands to an initially empty write FIFO, the MPU does not have to synchronize to write FIFO status. The ACRTC can fetch and execute these commands faster than the MPU can issue them.

**Command DMA Transfer**

Commands and parameters can be transferred from the MPU system memory by an external DMAC. The MPU initiates and terminates command DMA transfer under software control (CDM bit of CCR). Command DMA transfer can also be terminated by asserting the ACRTC DONĒ signal. DONĒ is an input in command DMA transfer mode.

In command DMA transfer mode, the ACRTC issues cycle stealing DMA requests to the DMAC when the write FIFO is ready. The DMA data is automatically sent from system memory to the ACRTC write FIFO regardless of the contents of the address register.

Make sure that the write FIFO is empty and all previous commands are terminated before starting the command DMA transfer.

Data DMA transfer cannot be executed in command DMA transfer mode.

### Table 5. Register Access Commands

| Command | Function |
|---|---|
| ORG | Initialize the relation between the origin point in the X-Y coordenates and the physical address |
| WPR | Write into parameter register |
| RPR | Read the parameter register |
| WPTN | Write into pattern RAM |
| RPTN | Read pattern RAM |

**Register Access Commands**

Registers associated with the drawing processor (pattern RAM and drawing parameter registers) are accessed throught the read and write FIFOs using register access commands (table 5).

**Data Transfer Commands**

Data transfer commands move blocks of data between the MPU system memory and the ACRTC frame buffer, or within the frame buffer itself (table 6). Before issuing these commands, a physical 20-bit frame buffer address must be specified in the RWP (read/write pointer) drawing parameter register.

**Graphic Drawing Commands**

The ACRTC has 23 graphic drawing commands (table 7). Graphic drawing is performed by modifying the contents of the frame buffer based on microcoded drawing algorithms in the ACRTC drawing processor.

Most drawing coordinate parameters are specified by logical pixel X-Y addresses. The ACRTC high-speed hardware performs the complex task of translating a logical pixel address to a linear frame buffer word address, and further, selecting the proper subfield of the word (for example, a 4-bit logical pixel might reside in bits 8-11 of a certain frame buffer word).

Many instructions allow specification in either absolute or relative X-Y coordinates (for example, ALINE and RLINE). In both cases, two's complement numbers represent both positive and negative values.

| WT | Write one word of data to the frame buffer specified by the read/write pointer (RWP) |
| MOD | Perform logical operation on one word in the frame buffer specified by the read/write pointer (RWP) (bit maskable) |
| CLR | Clear a rectangular area of the frame buffer with data in the command parameter |
| SCLR | Initialize a rectangular area of the frame buffer with 1-word data subject to logical operation (bit maskable) |

| SCPY | Copy frame buffer data from one area (source area) to another area (destination area) subject to logical modification by word. The source and destination areas must reside on the same screen (bit maskable) |

### Notes on System Design

**Power-On Sequence**

The conditions in figure 10 must be satisfied at power-on.

**Output Waveform**

If excessive ringing (figure 11) occurs on CRT data buses, (MAD₀-MAD₁₅, MA₁₆/RA₀-MA₁₉/RA₄), damping resistors may be required as shown in figure 12.

**Figure 10. Power-On Sequence** — Timing diagram showing Vcc rising from 0.8V to 4.5V with a t2CH interval of 100 ms marked at the crossing point; below it, a 2CLK-like waveform shown as a train of small oscillations settling to a steady level (labeled 2.2V for the 4/6/8 MHz versions, 2.4V for the 9.8 MHz version); further below, a reset-related signal transitions from a low level to a high level of 0.7V after an interval tREH of 100 ms.

**Figure 11. Ringing Noise** — A Vout vs. t waveform: the signal drops from VOH to VOL and settles with a damped oscillation ("Ringing Noise") superimposed near the VOL level. Note: The ringing level depends on the load capacity, and can be VOL + 0.1 V.

### Absolute Maximum Ratings

| Item | Symbol | Rating | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Supply Voltage | Vcc (Note 1) | −0.3 to +7.0 | V |
| Input Voltage | Vin (Note 1) | −0.3 to Vcc +0.3 | V |
| Allowable Output Current | \|IO\| (Note 2) | 5 | mA |
| Total Allowable Output Current | \|ΣIO\| (Note 3) | 120 | mA |
| Operating Temperature | Topr | 0 to +70 | °C |
| Storage Temperature | Tstg | −55 to +150 | °C |

Notes:
1. Referenced to Vss = 0 V.
2. The maximum current that may be drawn from, or flow out of, one output, or one common input/output terminal.
3. The total sum of currents that may be drawn from, or flow out of, all output or common input/output terminals.
4. Using an LSI beyond its maximum rating may result in its permanent destruction. LSIs should usually be used under recommended operating conditions. Exceeding any of these conditions may adversely affect reliability.

**Figure 18. MPU Read Cycle Timing (MPU ↔ ACRTC)** — A rotated (landscape) timing-diagram page showing five signal traces — 2CLK, R/W̄, RS, CS̄, D₀-D₁₅, and DTACK̄ — across a read cycle, split into three annotated regions along the time axis: "Asynchronous bus timing (1)", "Asynchronous bus timing (2)", and "Synchronous bus timing (The MPU read cycle timing is fixed.)". The 2CLK trace is drawn as a continuous square/triangle wave across all regions, with the T0, T1, …, Tn, Tn1, Tn2 clock-cycle labels marking successive clock edges. Each of R/W̄, RS, and CS̄ shows a transition referenced to 2.2V/0.7V threshold levels, with numbered callouts (matching the AC-characteristics table numbers, e.g. ⑥ ⑧ ⑨ ⑩ ⑦ etc.) marking the specific setup/hold intervals defined in the preceding timing tables. The D₀-D₁₅ trace shows a hatched "data valid" region bounded by Vcc-2.0V/0.8V levels with callouts for read data access/hold/turn-off timing (⑭ ⑮ ⑯ etc.). The DTACK̄ trace shows its low-going pulse with callouts ⑫ ⑬ ⑰ ⑱ ⑲ ⑳ ㉑ marking its delay, release, and turn-off timing relative to CS̄ and the data valid window. This pattern (one set of traces per labeled region) repeats three times across the page, once for each of the three timing-mode regions listed above.

Notes:
1. CS̄ high level width must satisfy specification ⑩②. Unless spec ⑩② is satisfied, DTACK̄ and read data responses to the succeeding cycle are delayed.
2. ⑩⓪, ⑩①, and ⑩② are synchronous bus timing specifications.

Note: VIH (input high voltage minimum value) is 2.2 V in 4-, 6-, 8-MHz version. Note that in 9.8 MHz version, VIH is 2.4 V.

**Figure 19. MPU Write Cycle Timing (MPU → ACRTC)** — A rotated (landscape) timing-diagram page, structured like Figure 18 but for a write cycle. Five signal traces — 2CLK, R/W̄, RS, CS̄, D₀-D₁₅, and DTACK̄ — are shown across three regions: "Asynchronous bus timing (1)", "Asynchronous bus timing (2)", and "Synchronous bus timing (The MPU write cycle timing is fixed.)". Numbered callouts (⑥⑧⑨⑩⑦, ⑰-㉔, etc., matching the AC-characteristics table entries) mark setup/hold/delay intervals on R/W̄, RS, CS̄, the write data valid window on D₀-D₁₅, and the DTACK̄ response pulse, referenced to 2.2V/0.7V (digital) and Vcc-2.0V/0.8V (data valid) threshold levels.

Notes:
1. CS̄ high width must satisfy the specification ⑩②. Unless spec ⑩② is satisfied, DTACK̄ response to the succeeding cycle is delayed.
2. When the ACRTC is used with the synchronous bus timing, the specifications ⑩⓪, ⑩① and ⑩② must be satisfied.

**Figure 20. MPU Read/Write Cycle Timing** — A rotated (landscape) timing-diagram page combining a read cycle immediately followed by a write cycle, using the same five traces (2CLK, R/W̄, RS, CS̄, D₀-D₁₅, DTACK̄) and the same numbered callout scheme as Figures 18-19, shown across several repeated clock-cycle blocks (T0...Tn2) to illustrate back-to-back read-then-write bus activity.

Note: When the MPU read cycle immediately follows the MPU write cycle execution, DTACK̄ and the read data responses are delayed (by 3 cycles of 2CLK) even though spec ⑩② is satisfied.

Note: VIH (input high voltage minimum value) is 2.2 V in 4-, 6-, 8-MHz version. Note that in 9.8 MHz version, VIH is 2.4 V.

**Figure 21. DMA Read Cycle Timing (Memory ↔ ACRTC)** — A rotated (landscape) timing-diagram page showing the DMA read cycle across traces 2CLK, DREQ̄, R/W̄, DACK̄, D₀-D₁₅, DTACK̄ (READY), and DONĒ (OUTPUT). The 2CLK trace runs continuously across clock periods T0…Tn2, with a break (dashed) shown to indicate an extended/variable number of cycles. Two DREQ̄ variants are shown, one for DRC="1" and one for DRC="0" (DMA Request Control bit), branching at the point DREQ̄ is asserted. Numbered callouts ㉕–㉚, ㉜–㊲ (matching the DMA Read/Write Cycle Timing table entries 25-42) mark the DREQ̄ delay times, R/W̄ and DACK̄ setup/hold times, the read-data valid window on D₀-D₁₅ (hatched region referenced to Vcc-2.0V/0.8V), and the DTACK̄/DONĒ delay and turn-off timings.

**Figure 22. DMA Ready Cycle Timing (Memory ↔ ACRTC): Burst Mode** — A rotated (landscape) timing-diagram page similar to Figure 21, but illustrating burst-mode DMA transfers: the 2CLK, DREQ̄, R/W̄, DACK̄, D₀-D₁₅, DTACK̄ (READY), and DONĒ (OUTPUT) traces are shown repeating across four consecutive burst sub-cycles (each a block of T0…Tn2 periods), with the same numbered callouts (㉖-㊴, ⑩④, ⑩⑤, ⑩⑥) marking DACK̄ cycle/pulse-width timing and the DTACK̄/READY response in each burst segment.

Note: DACK̄ high width must satisfy spec ⑩⑥. Unless spec ⑩⑥ is satisfied, DTACK̄ and the read data responses to the succeeding cycle are delayed. When the ACRTC is used with synchronous bus timing, the specifications ⑩④, ⑩⑤ and ⑩⑥ must be satisfied.

As in Figure 21, two DREQ̄ branches are shown for DRC="1" and DRC="0". Numbered callouts ㉖-㊵ mark the same class of setup/hold/delay timings as the DMA read cycle, applied here to the write-data valid window on D₀-D₁₅ and the DONĒ input/output handshake.

Note: *DONĒ must be asserted low while DACK̄ remains low. DONĒ low width must satisfy spec ㊳.

**Figure 30. EXSYNC̄ Input Timing** — Two stacked timing diagrams. The top one shows 2CLK, EXSYNC̄ (FROM MASTER), and HSYNC̄ (SLAVE): EXSYNC̄ is asserted (hatched transition region referenced to 0.7V/2.2V, callouts ⑦⑤,⑦⑦,⑦⑥) and, after an interval labeled "11 Cycle (2CLK)", the slave's HSYNC̄ responds (callout ⑥⑦, referenced to 0.8V).

The bottom diagram details the "(EXSYNC Rise Cycle)" relative to a "(Sync Cycle)" of labeled clock periods T0-T6: traces 2CLK, EXSYNC̄ (with the same ⑦⑤,⑦⑦,⑦⑥ callouts), and two alternative MCYC traces — one labeled "(Phase Shifted)" and one "(Phase Not Shifted)" — with curved arrows showing how the EXSYNC̄ rising edge realigns (phase-shifts) the MCYC clock when it falls within the marked window. Caption note: "(When the leading edge of EXSYNC̄ enters this period, ACRTC shifts the internal phase as shown.)"

Notes:
1. When LPSTB rises in the period (1), memory address M + 1 is set in the lightpen address register.
2. When LPSTB rises in the period (2), memory address M + 2 is set in the lightpen address register.

**Figure 35. IRQ̄ Output Timing (Example: Read FIFO Full Interrupt Enable)** — A timing diagram showing 2CLK across two labeled intervals ("4 to 5 Cycles (tcyc)" and "3 Cycles (tcyc)"), CS̄ (two pulses referenced to 0.7V/2.2V, callouts ⑩ each), D₀-D₁₅ (a hatched "Read Data" valid window, callouts ㉑,⑭), and IRQ̄ (rising to Vcc-2.0 then falling to 0.8V, callouts ⑧⑥,⑧⑤).

This is an IRQ̄ output timing example. In this case, IRQ̄ is generated by status flag RFF (Read FIFO Full).

When issuing read commands (RD) which transfer data exceeding Read FIFO space (8 words), the FIFO becomes full, and the command execution pauses (RFF: set, IRQ̄: generated). By reading out 1-word data, spare occurs in the FIFO, and the ACRTC resets RFF flag and then negates IRQ̄, while on the other hand the ACRTC resumes the internal operation (command execution) to fill the FIFO, and sets RFF flag and then asserts IRQ̄ again.

In this case, the timing from IRQ̄ negate to assert is 3 cycles (tcyc).

Note: VIH (input high voltage minimum value) is 2.2 V in 4-, 6-, 8-MHz version. Note that in 9.8 MHz version, VIH is 2.4 V.
