# Moving files in and out

You will want to get a file into CP/M, and to get a file back out. There is a board for this.

## The Host Bridge is our own board, not a period board

**MITS never made this board.** No S-100 maker made it. The `hostbridge` board is **our own**,
made for this simulator. The other way to move a file is a modem protocol over a simulated
serial port at 300 baud. That is slow and difficult, and it is needed only because the machine
is simulated.

Every other board in this program is a real product that somebody sold. This one is not, and you
should know which boards are which. It is in the manual with the real boards, and it is the only
one that was never sold.

It is in the **`default` machine**. Unless you wrote a machine file that leaves it out, **you
already have it.**

The default port is **B0**. `BASE+0` is command and status, and `BASE+1` is data.

## The three utilities, and where they are

The utilities are **on the disk**, not in the board. They are ordinary CP/M `.COM` files. They
were assembled in the machine, with the machine's own assembler, from source that ships with it.

For this reason, a disk can be without them. A minidisk image that you supply is one example,
and a disk that you formatted yourself is another. *Getting the utilities onto a disk that does
not have them*, below, tells you what to do.

| | |
|---|---|
| `HDIR [pattern]` | List what is on the host. |
| `R <hostfile> [cpmfile]` | Read host → CP/M. |
| `W <cpmfile> [hostfile] [B\|T]` | Write CP/M → host. |

### `HDIR`

```
A>HDIR
    1792  07/14/26  R.COM
     640  07/14/26  HDIR.COM
   <DIR>  07/20/26  SRC/

3 files.
A>HDIR *.ASM
```

`HDIR` lists one file on each line, with its size, date and name, like `ls -l` or `DIR`. The
size is a number of bytes, or `<DIR>` for a folder. A folder also keeps its `/` at the end,
which shows that `R` cannot read it as a file. The list is sorted. The count at the end is the
number of files in the host folder, which can be much more than a CP/M disk holds.

**`HDIR` always prints the TRUE host names**, with their real case and their real length. It
does not print the 8.3 names that CP/M will see. That is the purpose of `HDIR`. When you cannot
find the name of a file, ask `HDIR`.

### `R`: host to CP/M

```
A>R README.TXT
A>R *.ASM
A>R SRC/FOO.ASM
A>R SRC/FOO.ASM WORK.ASM
```

Wildcards work. Folders work, and **`/` and `\` both work on every host**, so you do not have to
remember which computer you use. A second argument gives the name of the file on the CP/M side,
instead of the automatic name.

### `W`: CP/M to host

```
A>W GAME.COM
A>W GAME.COM game.com
A>W NOTES.TXT notes.txt T
```

## `W` uses **B** by default

**Binary is the default.** `W` writes **every byte of every record**. It examines nothing,
removes nothing and guesses nothing. A `.COM` file arrives unchanged, and it runs.

There is a cost, and you can see it. **A text file arrives with up to 127 extra `Ctrl-Z` bytes**
at its end. CP/M stores files in 128-byte records and fills the last record. In binary mode, `W`
does not know which of those bytes you wanted, so it writes them all. Your editor shows them.
Remove them, or use `T`.

**`T` (text) stops at the first `Ctrl-Z`.** You get clean text, at the correct length.

This is why `T` is not the default: **a binary file that contains the byte `1Ah` comes back
TRUNCATED.** Byte `1Ah` is `Ctrl-Z`. It is an ordinary byte in a `.COM` file (the `LDAX D`
instruction). In text mode, the transfer stops at the first one, without a message, and you get
a file with the correct name and the wrong length. A text file with some extra bytes is better
than half a program that looks complete.

| Mode | What it does | Costs you |
|---|---|---|
| **`B`** (default) | Every byte. | Up to 127 `Ctrl-Z` bytes on a text file. |
| `T` | Stops at the first `Ctrl-Z`. | **Truncates any binary containing `1Ah`.** |

## The sandbox

The board has a **`hostdir`** property. It is the host folder that the guest can see, and it is
the **only** host folder that the guest can see.

```
altairsim> SET hb0 hostdir=/tmp/xfer
```

When `hostdir` is empty, the default, it is **the folder that you started `altairsim` from.**

### Where a relative `hostdir` points

`hostdir` is a path, so it follows the path rule in the machines chapter. A relative `hostdir`
starts from the machine's folder, whether you type it or a machine file gives it:

```
altairsim> SET hb0 hostdir=xfer          # the xfer folder beside the machine file
```

```toml
[[board]]
id      = "hb0"
hostdir = "xfer"                          # the same xfer folder
```

Both mean the same folder. It moves with the machine file, so an example folder that you copy to
another place still has its own transfer folder. For a built-in machine, which has no folder, a
relative `hostdir` starts from the folder that you started the program from.

**You do not have to work it out.** `SHOW hb0` prints the value as written and the folder that
it resolves to. The resolved folder is the limit:

```
altairsim> SHOW hb0
  property         value            legal
  port             0xB0             0x0..0xFE
  hostdir          xfer
  hostdir_root     /home/you/altair/disks/cpm22/xfer (read-only)
  readonly         false            true|false
```

`hostdir` is what was **written**. `hostdir_root` is where the limit **really is**. It is
read-only, because it is a fact about this run, not a setting, and the program never writes it
into a machine file.

`SHOW PATHS` prints the same folder, beside the base directory. If `R` cannot find a file that
you are sure you put in `xfer`, read that line to see which folder the guest uses.

### What the path rule means for `R` and `W`

The path rule stops at the board. **It does not reach the guest, and `R` and `W` never see it.**

At the `A>` prompt, you do not type a host path. You type a **name**, and the board finds it in
`hostdir_root`, and nowhere else:

```
A>R FOO.ASM          <- hostdir_root/FOO.ASM. Never your cwd, never the machine file's
A>W RESULT.TXT       <- hostdir_root/RESULT.TXT
```

The path rule affects `R` and `W` **one time only**. It decides which folder `hostdir` names.
After that, the guest has one folder, and it cannot name any other folder. The board refuses
`..`, an absolute path and a drive letter, as below.

The two mechanisms look alike, but they are different:

| | decides | confines |
|---|---|---|
| **the path rule** | where a path that you or a machine file gives points | nothing at all |
| **`hostdir`** | nothing you type | **everything the guest can reach** |

This is the *only* limit in the simulator. A machine file can mount a disk from any place on
your computer, but the CP/M program that runs from that disk still sees only `hostdir`.

**The guest cannot leave it.** The board refuses all of these, before anything touches your
files:

- an absolute path
- a drive letter
- any `..` component
- a symbolic link that points outside the root

This is a **fixed limit on purpose**, not a filter that does its best. The guest runs software
from 1977 that you found on the internet. You should not have to trust it.

`readonly` lets files go one way only:

```
altairsim> SET hb0 readonly=on
```

Files come **out of** the host. Nothing goes back in, and `W` fails.

## The guest can write to your working folder

This is the other half of the rule, and you must know it:

**By default, software in the guest can read and write the folder that you started `altairsim`
from.**

This is on unless you turn it off. It is a **decision**, not a mistake. `R FOO.ASM` works as
soon as you unzip the package, with no setup, and the folder that you are in is usually the
folder that you want. However, it is your folder, with your files in it, and a CP/M program that
you did not write can reach them.

If you do not want this, point `hostdir` at a different folder, or set `readonly=on`. Each one
is one command.

## Names: 8.3, and how a host name becomes one

CP/M names have eight characters and an extension of three, and host names do not. The board
changes a host name in these steps:

1. It changes the host name to **upper case**.
2. It cuts the name to **8** characters.
3. It cuts the extension to **3** characters.
4. It **removes characters that CP/M does not allow.**

```
my-notes(2).txt   →   MYNOTES2.TXT
```

**A second argument sets the whole name.** Use it when you do not like the result of the steps:

```
A>R my-notes(2).txt NOTES.TXT
```

`HDIR` prints the **true** host names, so you can always see the name that you ask for.

## Case, and why the board does not guess

**The CP/M command line changes everything to upper case.** The CCP does this, before your
program sees the line. When `R` runs, `R readme.txt` and `R README.TXT` are **the same
command**. The case is lost.

For this reason, the board does these steps, in this order:

1. **An exact match wins.** If a file has exactly the name that you asked for, the board uses
   that file.
2. **Otherwise, it ignores case and looks again.** `README.TXT` finds `readme.txt`.
3. **If more than one file matches, it REFUSES.**

Step 3 is the important one. If your folder has `readme.txt`, `README.TXT` and `ReadMe.Txt`, the
board does not choose one. It does not choose the newest, and it does not choose the first. **It
tells you that it cannot decide**, and it stops. A file transfer that guesses wrong and says
that it worked is worse than one that fails.

## Getting the utilities onto a disk that does not have them

There is a problem with all of the above: **you use `R` to get a file onto a disk, and `R` is a
file on the disk.** If you boot a disk without it, such as a minidisk image that you supplied or
a new disk that you made, you cannot use the board to get the program that uses the board.

You solve this with **the console**, which works before any file-transfer program does. You
enter the program through the console. You do not type it. You paste it.

**You cannot paste `R.COM`.** It is binary, and a console carries text. The first `1Ah` in it
would end the paste, and the bytes above `7Fh` would not arrive correctly. For this reason, you
paste **`R.HEX`**, the file that `LOAD` changes into `R.COM`. It is Intel HEX: colons, hex
digits and line ends, about 5.2 KB of them, and every byte can be printed.

**It ships with the package.** The utilities are in `hostbridge/`, with the 8080 sources, the
`.HEX` files and the assembled `.COM` files. The CP/M disk in `examples/cpm` already has
`R.COM`, `W.COM` and `HDIR.COM`. For this reason, this section is about the other kind of disk:
a new disk, or a minidisk image that you brought. For the paste below, open `hostbridge/R.HEX`.

1. **Tell PIP to write a file from the console.**

   ```
   A>PIP R.HEX=CON:
   ```

   PIP now copies what you type into `R.HEX`, until you tell it to stop.

2. **Paste all of `R.HEX` into the terminal.** Open `R.HEX` on your computer, select all of it,
   and paste it into the window where `altairsim` runs. PIP shows each line as it arrives, about
   117 lines. That shows you that the guest receives it.

3. **End it with `Ctrl-Z`.**

   ```
   ^Z
   A>
   ```

   `Ctrl-Z` is CP/M's end-of-file mark on the console, and it closes the file. You are at the
   `A>` prompt, and `R.HEX` is on the disk.

4. **Change the HEX file into a program.**

   ```
   A>LOAD R

   FIRST ADDRESS 0100
   LAST  ADDRESS 083E
   BYTES READ    073F
   RECORDS WRITTEN 0F
   ```

   `LOAD` reads `R.HEX` and writes `R.COM`. It adds the `.HEX` itself, so `LOAD R` is the whole
   command. Check `FIRST ADDRESS 0100`. A CP/M program starts at `100h`. If that line shows a
   different value, the paste lost something.

5. **Use `R`, and you do not need to paste again.**

   ```
   A>R W.COM
   A>R HDIR.COM
   ```

   `R.COM` now exists, so the other two utilities come across the board as ordinary binary
   files, with no HEX, no `LOAD` and no paste. `hostdir` must point at the folder that holds
   them. On a built-in machine, such as `minidisk`, that you started in the package folder,
   type:

   ```
   altairsim> SET hb0 hostdir=hostbridge
   ```

   For a machine file in another folder, give the path from that folder, or a full path.

### Two problems of the real hardware that do not happen here

**No character is lost, however fast you paste.** On a real Altair, 5 KB sent to a 300-baud
serial board with no flow control overruns the UART, and characters are lost in the middle of a
HEX record. That cannot happen here. The simulated 6850 and 1602 UARTs deliver bytes at the line
rate, but **they take a byte only when the receive register is free**. The next byte waits on
the host side, and nothing is lost. A paste of any size arrives complete. This is different from
the hardware on purpose, because the host connection does not lose data.

**A bad paste tells you.** Every Intel HEX record has a checksum, and `LOAD` checks it. A
damaged line gives an error. It does not give a program that almost works.

### Build them from source in the same way

When you paste `R.HEX`, you get the program. When you paste `R.ASM`, you get the program *and*
the source, so that you can change it. The disk's own `ASM.COM` assembles it, and `LOAD`
finishes the job as above:

```
A>PIP R.ASM=CON:
   ...paste R.ASM, ^Z...
A>ASM R
A>LOAD R
```

It is the same method with a longer paste, about 34 KB instead of 5.2 KB. The `.COM` files in
`hostbridge/` were built in this way. If you only want to *run* the utility, paste the HEX file.
It is about six times shorter, and it needs no assembler on the disk.

## Why one `R.COM` works on every disk

**Every file operation goes through CP/M's BDOS.** It does not use the BIOS or a disk parameter
block. It makes no assumption about how many sectors are on a track, or where the directory is.

`R` and `W` open, read, write and close files with the same BDOS calls as any CP/M program, and
the BDOS knows about your disk. For this reason, the same `R.COM`, with no changes, runs on:

- the 8″ floppy controller
- the 8 MB disk
- the minidisk
- **any BIOS that anybody writes later**, for a controller that does not exist yet

That was the goal of the design. The board is not a period board, but the software that uses it
is an ordinary CP/M program, and it will work on a machine that you have not built yet.
