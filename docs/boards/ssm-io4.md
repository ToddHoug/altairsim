# SSM IO-4 (2P + 2S) — two serial and four parallel ports

**Status:** done — both serial channels (real 1602-family UARTs, the full W1/W2 status strap-up,
port reversal, the word-format switches), all four 8212 parallel ports with their
service-request flip-flops and the §3.2.2 status/data console strap, the S3/S4 address
switches with their overlap rule, and the W4 interrupt header. Board type `io4`. See
`examples/io4/io4.toml` and `tests/test_io4.cpp`.

**Not modelled:** the current-loop and EIA electrical options, separate RX and TX rates on the
W3 header, the UART error flags (they read inactive), and the parallel *output* handshake. See
*Limitations*.

## The real hardware

The **IO-4** ("10-4, 2P + 2S" in its own manual) is an S-100 I/O board from **SSM
Microcomputer Products**, formerly **Solid State Music**. The board is © 1977 and the manual is
dated 3-19-79. It puts two unrelated sections on one board:

- **Serial:** two independent full-duplex asynchronous channels, each a 40-pin UART —
  **U9 = Serial A, U8 = Serial B**, a TMS6011 / AY5-1013 / TR-1602. Each channel has its own
  word-format DIP switch (**S2 = Serial A, S1 = Serial B**), its own status header (**W2 = A,
  W1 = B**), its own status buffer (**U18 = A, U16 = B**), and its own line interface: an
  opto-isolated 20/60 mA current loop or EIA RS-232 (DS1488 driver).
- **Parallel:** four latched 8-bit ports on **8212** latch-buffers — two in (**J4**, **J6**)
  and two out (**J3**, **J5**) — each input with a service-request flip-flop.

Each section has its own address switch: **S3** puts the serial section on a 4-port block
(A7–A2), **S4** puts the parallel section on a 2-port block (A7–A1). If the two blocks overlap,
**neither section answers** the shared ports.

What made the board popular is the **status-word strap-up**. Six UART status signals come to a
16-pin header and can be jumpered to any data-bus bit. The status buffer can be a 74367
(positive sense) or a 74368 (every bit inverted). A PR switch per channel swaps the status and
data addresses. Together these let one IO-4 answer like almost any other board's serial port,
and the manual's §4 gives the strapping for the common ones.

## Register reference

### Serial section — a 4-port block at `port` (switch S3, default `00`)

| Addr | OUT (write) | IN (read) |
|---|---|---|
| BASE+0 | Serial A control — **accepted and discarded** (the UART has no control register) | Serial A status byte, shaped by W2 + U18 |
| BASE+1 | Serial A transmit data (`/TDS`) | Serial A receive data (`/RDAR` — clears DAV) |
| BASE+2 | Serial B control — discarded | Serial B status byte, shaped by W1 + U16 |
| BASE+3 | Serial B transmit data | Serial B receive data (clears DAV) |

With a channel's **PR** switch on (`port_reversal`), that channel's two addresses swap: data
first, status second. Each channel reverses on its own.

### The status byte

Six UART signals, each jumpered to one data bit or left off (`stat_dav`, `stat_ror`,
`stat_rpe`, `stat_rfe`, `stat_teoc`, `stat_tbmt`: `0`–`7` or `none`):

| Signal | W1/W2 pin | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| DAV (ODA) | 4 | a received character is waiting |
| ROR | 3 | receiver overrun |
| RPE | 2 | receiver parity error |
| RFE | 7 | receiver framing error |
| TEOC | 6 | transmitter end of character (the shift register is empty) |
| TBMT | 5 | transmitter buffer empty (ready for the next character) |

The polarity is set by the buffer chip: a 74367 reads asserted as 1, a 74368 reads asserted as
0 (`invert_status`). A bit that no signal is strapped to reads 0.

The `profile` property presets the map, the polarity and PR together from the manual's §4:

| Profile | Manual | DAV | TBMT | Others | Sense | PR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`altair-rev1`** (default) | §4.2 | D0 | D7 | — | inverted (74368) | off |
| `altair-rev0` | §4.3 | D5 | D1 | — | positive | off |
| `i8251` | §4.1 | D1 | D0 | TEOC D2, RPE D3, ROR D4, RFE D5 | positive | off |
| `proctech` | §4.4 | D6 | D7 | — | positive | off |
| `imsai` | §4.5 | D1 | D0 | — | positive | **on** |

`profile` reads back whichever row the live straps match, or `custom`. The straps are the real
settings; the profile name is only read back from them.

### Parallel section — a 2-port block at `par_port` (switch S4, default `04`)

| Addr | OUT (write) | IN (read) |
|---|---|---|
| PAR+0 | Parallel A output latch (J5, U12) | Parallel A input latch (J6, U13) — **clears its service request** |
| PAR+1 | Parallel B output latch (J3, U10) | Parallel B input latch (J4, U11) — clears its service request |

The manual's §3.2.2 status/data idiom puts a data-available flag on one bit of a parallel
port's read, taken from that port's service request or its sibling's. That is wiring on the J
connectors, so it is a set of per-port straps: `dav_bit` (`0`–`7` or `none`), `dav_source`
(`self` or `sibling`) and `dav_active_low`.

### Interrupts — header W4

| Source | Unit property | Canonical W4 line | Asserted while |
|---|---|---|---|
| Serial A receive | `a` `rx_int` | VI1 | DAV |
| Serial B receive | `b` `rx_int` | VI0 | DAV |
| Serial A transmit | `a` `tx_int` | VI2 | TBMT |
| Serial B transmit | `b` `tx_int` | VI3 | TBMT |
| Parallel in A | `pa` `int` | VI6 | the service request is set |
| Parallel in B | `pb` `int` | VI5 | the service request is set |

Each strap takes `none` (the default), `int` (pin 73, PINT) or `vi0`–`vi7`. The canonical
column is the manual's W4 map; the simulator does not force it, because W4 is a header of
jumpers.

## How it is simulated

- **Bus cycles:** `IoRead` and `IoWrite` only, never memory. `sectionAt()` decides which section
  owns a port and returns *neither* for a port both blocks cover. It is the only place the
  overlap rule is written.
- **The UARTs** are `Uart1602` chips (`src/chips/uart1602.h`), one per channel, in true sense.
  Everything that makes the status byte look like another board — the map, the polarity, PR —
  belongs to the board and is applied in `Io4Board::statusByte()` (`DESIGN.md` §7.8, *A chip
  is not a card*).
- **Word format** (`data_bits` 5–8, `parity` none/odd/even, `stop_bits` 1–2 — the S1/S2
  switches) and **`baud`** are per channel. They pace the emulated line — TBMT falls on a
  write and rises one character time later, and received characters arrive at no more than
  the line rate — and they are programmed onto a real serial port when one is connected.
- **Parallel ports** are units `pa` and `pb`, one bidirectional `ByteStream` each. A byte the
  far end sends *is* the external strobe: `pump()` latches it into the input latch and sets the
  service request. The latch is one byte deep, so the next byte waits until the guest reads
  this one. A guest write sets the output latch and sends the byte down the line.
- **Streams:** four units (`a`, `b`, `pa`, `pb`), each a `ByteStream` — so a file, a socket, a
  real serial port, `in:`/`out:`, `null` or `loopback` all work. An unconnected unit holds a
  `NullStream`, never a null pointer.
- **Interrupts** are combinational: `assertsInt()` and `assertsVi()` read the live UART and
  service-request state through the W4 straps. There is **no software enable** on this board,
  so a strap wires the source's level straight to the bus. The board's own `Clock` alarm
  (`refresh()`/`nextEdge()`) wakes it when a strapped source can change with nobody touching
  the board: a transmitter finishing, or a paced character arriving. The alarm is cancelled in
  the destructor.
- **No bus mastering. No media.**
- **Properties:** board-level `port` (must be a multiple of 4) and `par_port` (must be a
  multiple of 2); per serial unit `profile`, the six `stat_*`, `invert_status`,
  `port_reversal`, `baud`, `data_bits`, `stop_bits`, `parity`, `rx_int`, `tx_int`, `connect`;
  per parallel unit `dav_bit`, `dav_source`, `dav_active_low`, `int`, `connect`.

### Reset

`Reset::PowerOn` and `Reset::Bus` do the same thing:

- Each UART takes **MR** (pin 21): TBMT and TEOC set, DAV and the error flags cleared.
- Each parallel port's input latch, output latch and service request are cleared.
- **The lines stay connected.** A warm reset does not unplug a terminal or a ribbon cable.
- Every interrupt source is now inactive; the wires are driven again and the alarm is re-armed.

SNAPSHOT carries the UARTs, the four 8212 latches and the service requests. The straps are
config and are re-applied from the machine file.

## Quirks reproduced

| Quirk | If you get it wrong |
|---|---|
| The default profile is `altair-rev1`: DAV on D0, TBMT on D7, **both inverted** | The SSM 8080 monitor waits while D0 = 1 and while D7 = 1. With positive sense its console hangs at power-on, before printing anything |
| Reading the serial **data** port clears DAV; reading the status port does not | A driver that polls status in a loop would either see one character forever or lose characters |
| A write to the serial **status** port is ignored | The 1602 has no control register. Treating the write as one would let init code that "programs a UART" change the format, which the real board sets with DIP switches |
| PR swaps a channel's two addresses | IMSAI software reads status at the higher address. Without PR it reads the data port as status |
| Overlapping S3 and S4 blocks: **neither** section answers the shared ports | Letting one section win would make a mis-strapped machine work when the real board would go silent |
| A parallel input raises its interrupt **even when the port is not addressed** | An interrupt-driven parallel reader would never be woken |
| The transmit interrupt is a **level**, held while TBMT is set | Treating it as an edge loses the "ready for the next character" request that interrupt-driven output relies on |
| No software interrupt enable — the W4 strap is the enable | Adding an enable bit would give the board a register it never had (`DESIGN.md` §0.1) |
| A bit no signal is strapped to reads **0**, even with `invert_status` on | Inverting the undriven bits too would put 1s in positions a driver masks off and never expects to see set |

## Limitations and deliberate departures

- **ROR, RPE and RFE always read inactive.** They report line noise, and a `ByteStream`
  delivers the byte that was sent or nothing. Making up a noise rate would mean inventing a
  number (`DESIGN.md` §0.1). ROR has a second reason: a stream holds a byte until the board
  takes it, so an overrun would *manufacture* data loss that the host link does not have (see
  `Uart1602::poll()`). They can still be strapped, so a driver that masks them (the `i8251`
  profile) sees the right byte shape. Software that tests its own error handling by forcing
  a framing error cannot do that here.
- **One `baud` per channel.** W3 straps RX and TX separately, so a real channel could send
  and receive at different rates. A host serial port cannot be split that way, so both
  directions share one rate. `baud` accepts any rate from 50 to 25000, not only the ten W3
  rates (55–9600), and the rate is counted in the guest's T-states rather than divided down
  from the bus's 2 MHz Φ2. The §4.7 (Selectric 133.5 baud) and §4.11 (PolyMorphic ÷12) board
  mods come for free as a `baud` value.
- **Current loop, EIA, and the §4.8–§4.10 line mods are not modelled.** They are electrical
  choices, not something a program can see.
- **The parallel output handshake is not modelled.** The manual gives the output ports a
  service-request flip-flop worked by the strobe line, but an output here only latches and
  sends. Software that waits for a printer's ACK on an output port's flip-flop would not see it.
  The input side is complete.
- **Each parallel port is one bidirectional line.** On the real board, J6 (in) and J5 (out) are
  separate ribbon cables. Here both directions of Parallel A share one endpoint, as a serial
  line does.

## Verification

- `test_io4` (unit, `./build/altair_tests io4`): the four units; the S3 and S4 block rules;
  every profile's byte shape; `invert_status` and `port_reversal`; a custom map; the data path
  both ways and the discarded control write; channel independence; per-channel word format;
  the single `baud`; the parallel strobe/ack, output latch, the §3.2.2 console strap and the
  overlap rule; reset clearing the latches. It then **boots the SSM 8080 System Monitor** on
  Serial A of a hand-built machine and reads its sign-on back. The interrupt sections cover W4
  unstrapped, a receive on pin 73 and on a VI line, the transmit level, an unaddressed parallel
  strobe, several straps at once, a board with no clock, and two end-to-end runs where an 8080
  behind an 88-VI vectors to `RST 2` (Serial A receive on VI2) and `RST 6` (a parallel strobe
  on VI6).
- `acceptance-io4`: boots `examples/io4/io4.toml` — the file a package holder gets — through the
  real CLI, and checks the SSM monitor's sign-on on the IO-4 console.
