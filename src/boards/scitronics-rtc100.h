// SciTronics RTC-100 -- an S-100 battery-backed real-time clock/calendar.
// See docs/boards/scitronics-rtc100.md and
// reference/SciTronics RTC-100 Real-Time Clock.md (SciTronics Inc., Bethlehem PA,
// software (c) 1980, schematic dated 9-7-80).
//
// THE CLOCK CHIP IS NOT THIS CARD'S WORK. The RTC-100 carries an OKI MSM5832 --
// the same chip the CompuPro System Support 1 carries -- and chips/msm5832.h
// already models it, down to the battery-backed offset that survives RESET. That
// header says "the next card with an MSM5832 gets this for free"; this is that
// card, and it adds no clock logic of its own.
//
// WHAT THIS CARD IS, THEN, IS A 6821 PIA WITH A CLOCK BEHIND IT. Where the SS-1
// wires the MSM5832's command and data lines straight to two I/O ports, the
// RTC-100 puts a Motorola 6821 in between, and the guest drives the clock by
// manipulating PIA pins. That translation is this board's whole job:
//
//   base+0   PIA A -- data or direction register (CRA bit 2 picks which)
//              data: digit ADDRESS in the low nibble, digit DATA in the HIGH nibble
//              direction: 0FH = low nibble out / high nibble in (the read set-up)
//                         FFH = all eight out          (the write set-up)
//   base+1   PIA A control -- CA2 drives the clock's HOLD line
//              CA2 LOW  = Hold asserted = clock stopped, display frozen
//              CA2 HIGH = run
//   base+2   PIA B -- the clock's WRITE strobe: 0 = pulse on, 1 = pulse off
//   base+3   PIA B control -- CB2 drives the clock's READ line
//
// A READ THEREFORE COMES BACK IN THE HIGH NIBBLE, with the digit code the guest
// wrote still sitting in the low nibble -- the two nibbles face opposite ways
// through one 8-bit port. That is why every driver ever written for this card ends
// with `ANI 0F0H` and four `RRC`, and it is the single most characteristic thing
// about the board.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ONLY AS MUCH PIA AS THE CLOCK NEEDS, AND SAID OUT LOUD.
//
// This is NOT a general 6821 (the 88-4PIO's 6820 file is closer to that). Modeled:
// the two control registers' DDR/data select (bit 2) and CA2/CB2 output level (bit
// 3, under the bits-5:4 = output-mode the card always uses), the two direction
// registers, and the two data registers. NOT modeled: CA1/CB1 inputs, the IRQA/IRQB
// flags and their read-clears, the pulse/handshake CA2 modes, and any input path on
// port B. Nothing on this card is wired to them -- the clock's Hold/Read/Write are
// the only loads -- so a guest that programs them observes nothing, which is what
// the docs/boards Limitations section says.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE INTERRUPT IS THE CARD'S OWN, AND IT IS NOT A VI STRAP.
//
// The RTC-100 requests an interrupt once per second and then VECTORS ITSELF: it
// claims the acknowledge cycle and jams `RST n` onto the data bus, where n comes
// from the 3-position INT dip switch (manual p8-9, Table II -- the switch is
// NEGATIVE logic, ON = 0). There is no VI connector on the card, so there is no
// vi0..vi7 strap here: `interrupt` is none|int, and `restart` is the switch. A
// board that offered eight VI levels would be a board that never existed.
//
// The second is WALL time -- the chip's crystal, not the CPU's -- so the tick is a
// Clock deadline scheduled off tStatesPer(), the same way the 88-VI's RTC does it.
