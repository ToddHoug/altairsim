// Cromemco D+7A -- an S-100 analog + parallel I/O card (1976). See reference/D+7A.md,
// reference/JS-1.md and docs/boards/cromemco-d7a.md.
//
// A BLOCK OF EIGHT CONSECUTIVE I/O PORTS, and no memory.
//
//   BASE+0 (default 0x18) -- a PARALLEL port. IN reads eight parallel input lines,
//                            OUT latches eight parallel output lines. Independent.
//   BASE+1..BASE+7        -- SEVEN ANALOG channels. IN <ch> hands back the A/D of that
//                            channel's analog input; OUT <ch> latches that channel's D/A
//                            output. Read and write are INDEPENDENT -- in one direction a
//                            port is an A/D input pin, in the other a D/A output pin
//                            (which is why a JS-1's X-axis A/D-in and its speaker D/A-out
//                            share one port number). Values are 8-bit TWO'S-COMPLEMENT,
//                            20 mV/LSB: 0x00 = 0 V, 0x7F = +2.54 V, 0x80 = -2.56 V.
//
// THE JS-1 JOYSTICK LIVES HERE, NOT ON ITS OWN CARD. A JS-1 console is a peripheral
// that plugs into the D+7A over a cable (reference/JS-1.md); one D+7A carries one or
// two. Cromemco's recommended wiring, which this card follows: console 1's X/Y pots ->
// analog inputs 0x19/0x1A, its four buttons -> parallel-input bits D0-D3; console 2 ->
// 0x1B/0x1C and D4-D7. The stick itself comes from the host Joystick service
// (host/joystick.h), injected at the composition root like a Display -- a USB gamepad
// in the shipping binary, the keyboard as a fallback, a NullJoystick (centered, no
// buttons) headless. The card never touches SDL.
//
// THE JS-1 SPEAKER IS A D/A OUTPUT. A JS-1 makes sound by the CPU writing a waveform to
// the speaker's analog-OUTPUT port in a timed loop (console 1: 0x19; console 2: 0x1B, or
// 0x1A as the Dazzler II wires it). write() records each change of a speaker channel
// with the T-state it happened at; pump() turns the slice's changes into PCM (LevelPcm)
// and hands it to the host Audio service (host/audio.h), injected like the Joystick. The
// card never touches SDL, and nothing is pushed from inside a bus cycle.
//
// SOUND NEEDS A CRYSTAL. The samples are made at one second of sound per EMULATED second.
// A machine running flat out (clock_hz = 0) has no fixed relation to real time, so the
// board plays nothing then, and SHOW says why.
//
// POLLED, and no interrupts. The parallel port's STB handshake and the analog wait
// states (reference/D+7A.md 4) are not modeled. A polling driver is complete without
// them; a tone loop runs a little fast, and so plays a little sharp.
