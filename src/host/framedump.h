// framedump -- get a video board's frame OUT of the simulator, for a person to look at
// and for a test to diff (DESIGN.md 7.4).
//
// A board paints an Indexed8 Surface and hands the host a palette; that is all a
// Display ever sees, and it is all a test can read back through a NullDisplay
// (display_null.h). But a Surface is a pile of palette indices, and "is pixel (32,0)
// index 1" is a poor way to say "the picture is right". These are the two forms a
// frame takes once it leaves the seam:
//
//   THE TEXT GRID (frameText)  -- one character per pixel, from a legend. This is what
//        an assertion is written against: it is diffable, it prints legibly in a
//        FAIL line, and for a small frame the EXPECTED picture is a raw string
//        literal sitting in the test where a reader can see it.
//
//   THE IMAGE (framePpm)       -- the frame resolved through its palette into 24-bit
//        RGB and wrapped as a binary PPM (P6). Any image viewer opens it and it needs
//        no library, no compression and no endianness. This is what you OPEN when the
//        grid disagrees and you need to see what the board actually drew.
//
// Plus frameCrc, a whole frame as one number over the RESOLVED RGB (so a palette-only
// change moves it) -- the one-line escape for a frame too big to keep either way.
//
// Resolving index -> Color here is the same operation the SDL back end performs when it
// uploads a frame, and for a board with a RAMDAC it is literally the DAC in software:
// what these functions hand back is what the wire carries.
//
// NOTHING ON THE SEAM CHANGES for this. Surface::pixels() is public and NullDisplay
// keeps each owner's surface and palette; these are pure functions over the two.

// How frameText() draws a pixel.
//
//   legend  -- index i prints as legend[i]; an index past the legend's end prints '?', so a
//              stray value is visible rather than aliased onto a real color. The default
//              names the sixteen entries a Dazzler or a 4-bpp board uses; a test with a
//              256-entry palette picks a legend that names the entries it loaded.
//   xStep,  -- sample every Nth column / row. A 64x64 frame reads 1:1; a 512x208 VDM-1
//   yStep      frame does not, and stepping by the glyph cell makes each character one
//              character cell. Must be >= 1.

};

// The frame as text: ceil(h/yStep) lines of ceil(w/xStep) characters, each line ending in
// '\n'. Row 0 is the top of the picture.
std::string frameText(const Surface& s, const TextGridOpts& o = {});

// CRC-32 of frameRgb(). Two frames that look the same have the same CRC; a palette change
// with no repaint changes it, which is the point of hashing the resolved bytes.
