//
// Speaker -- one voice: a held level that a guest moves, played through the host Audio
// service (host/audio.h, DESIGN.md 7.4).
//
// This is the part every D/A-driven speaker shares, so a board does not write it again:
// the Cromemco D+7A's JS-1 speakers and the Newtech Model 6 are both a latch into a D/A
// that a program writes in a timed loop. The board keeps the latch. This keeps the sound
// that the latch has been sent and is not yet rendered, and the rules for when a slice of
// emulated time becomes sound and when it is dropped (see pump()).
//
// A BOARD CALLS IT IN TWO PLACES. In write(), edge() with the T-state and the new level:
// that is all a bus cycle does. In Board::pump(), pump(): render the slice and push it.
// Nothing is pushed from inside a bus cycle.
//
// THE ADDRESS OF A Speaker IS ITS Audio::Owner. One Speaker is one voice, and the service
// mixes the voices, so a board with two speakers holds two of these.
//
// SOUND NEEDS A CRYSTAL. The samples are made at one second of sound per EMULATED second.
// A machine running flat out (Clock::free()) has no fixed relation to real time, so
// nothing is played then, and status() says why.
