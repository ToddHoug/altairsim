// EMULATED second, so the two must run at the same speed for the sound to be right.
// Each rule below is one way they do not:
//
//   flat out        no crystal: emulated time has no fixed relation to real time, and
//                   the slice is dropped. Nothing is played, at any pitch.
//   not driven      a level that does not move is silence. Nothing is pushed, so a guest
//                   that never touches the speaker never opens a sound device.
//   queue empty     the device has caught up (or has not started). A short cushion goes
//                   in first, or the device would run dry between this slice and the
//                   next and every slice would start with a gap.
//   queue deep      the machine is ahead of the device -- a run that nothing paces, with
//                   a crystal set. The slice is dropped, so the delay cannot grow.
