// LevelPcm -- a held level that changes at emulated instants, rendered to fixed-rate PCM.
//
// This is the conversion a D/A-driven speaker needs. The guest writes a level to a latch
// at a T-state; the latch holds it until the next write; a sound device wants a sample
// every 1/rate of a second. Neither a board nor a host backend: no Clock, no Audio, no
// SDL. A board feeds it edges and asks for samples; a test does the same with numbers.
//
// EACH SAMPLE IS THE AVERAGE OF THE LEVEL OVER THAT SAMPLE'S TIME, not the level at one
// instant in it. A guest's square wave has its edges wherever its timing loop puts them,
// almost never on a sample boundary. Taking the level at one instant moves every edge to
// a boundary, and the error is a tone of its own (an alias) under the real one. The
// average puts an edge that falls 30% into a sample at 30% of the step.
//
// TIME IS COUNTED IN WHOLE UNITS, so slices join exactly. One unit is 1/(hz * rate) of a
// second: a T-state is `rate` units and a sample is `hz` units. The part of a sample that
// a render() call leaves unfinished is carried to the next call, so rendering one second
// in a thousand calls gives the same samples as rendering it in one -- no click at a
// slice boundary, and no drift however long the machine runs.
