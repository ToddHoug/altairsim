// `pty` and `pty:LINK` -- a serial line on a pseudo-terminal, as a ByteStream
// (issue #685).
//
// THE LINE IS THE PSEUDO-TERMINAL. A terminal program (`screen`, `minicom`, `cu`, a
// file transfer program) opens the link as it opens a serial port, and it is the only
// thing on the line. Contrast `<endpoint>|pty` (host/mirror_stream.h), where the
// pseudo-terminal is a rider on some other line and must never reach the guest's pins.
//
// A PROGRAM OPENING THE LINK *IS* CARRIER APPEARING -- host/tcp.h's mapping, for the
// same reason: it is what a terminal on the far end of a cable looks like to the board.
//
//   a program opens the link    -> DCD and DSR rise
//   it closes the link          -> DCD and DSR fall, and a 6850 latches that
//   the kernel buffer fills     -> CTS falls, so the GUEST waits and loses no byte
//
// ONE THING IS NOT THE SOCKET'S: WITH NOBODY THERE, CTS STAYS UP. A socket with no
// caller negates CTS, and a board that has CTS wired then waits. A line that nobody
// has opened must not stop the guest, so here the output goes nowhere and the board
// is told it may send.
//
// NOTHING IS ECHOED AND NOTHING IS TRANSLATED. platform::Pty keeps the slave side in
// raw mode, so the line is 8-bit clean in both directions -- XMODEM works on it.
