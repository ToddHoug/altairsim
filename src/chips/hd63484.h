// Hitachi HD63484 ACRTC -- Advanced CRT Controller. A CHIP, NOT A CARD, exactly as the
// FD1771 and the 8257 next door are. The cadzilla video board has one; the next board
// that turns up with an ACRTC gets it for free.
//
// A CRT controller with a DRAWING PROCESSOR and its OWN frame memory: up to 1 M words
// of 16 bits that the host never addresses directly. The host talks to it through two
// locations and a pair of FIFOs -- it sets the raster timing in ~30 control registers,
// then draws by issuing COMMANDS ("line to (x, y)", "clear this rectangle") that the
// chip executes against the frame memory in logical X-Y pixel coordinates at 1, 2, 4,
// 8 or 16 bits per pixel. The picture is whatever is in that memory, scanned out through
// the display-control registers.
//
// SOURCES (docs/sources.md). Modeled from the Hitachi datasheet (reference/Hitachi
// HD63484 ACRTC.md, register LAYOUT) and the Hitachi HD63484 User's Manual
// (reference/Hitachi HD63484 ACRTC User's Manual.md, register and command SEMANTICS --
// #U75, Nov 1984) -- every register field, every status rule and every opcode below cites
// one of them. MAME's hd63484.cpp (BSD-3-Clause,
// (c) Angelo Salese, Sandro Ronco; LICENSE-MAME-HD63484) was read as the STRUCTURAL
// basis -- the shape of the register file, the FIFO, the command dispatch and the
// scan-out -- and where it and the datasheet disagree the datasheet won (the FIFO is 8
// words deep, not 16; a line's pattern scan starts at PPX, not PSX). Nothing here was
// derived by running it.
//
// It knows nothing about S-100 and nothing about the board's ports. The CARD decodes two
// consecutive I/O locations onto some base and forwards each as RS (0 or 1); the card
// also decided how much DRAM it fitted (the constructor) and how the 16-bit frame-memory
// word reaches its shift register (see scanline()).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE HOST INTERFACE (datasheet "Hardware Access"; manual 5.1-5.4)
//
//   RS=0  write -> ADDRESS REGISTER (AR), 8 bits: which control register RS=1 reaches.
//         read  -> STATUS REGISTER (SR):  CER ARD CED LPD RFF RFR WFR WFE  (D7..D0)
//   RS=1  the 16-bit control register AR names, or the FIFOs when AR = 0.
//
// 8-BIT MPU MODE (manual 5.2, 5.4, 6.2), which is the only mode an 8-bit S-100 host can
// use and the only one modeled: every control register is 16 bits, so each is TWO byte
// locations -- an EVEN AR reaches the high byte, an ODD AR the low byte. Accesses to
// r80-rFF (the timing and display-control RAM) auto-increment AR by one so a block load
// needs one AR write; accesses to r00-r7F do not. The FIFOs sit at AR = 0 and pair bytes
// HIGH THEN LOW into 16-bit words with AR left alone.
//
// THE FIFOs (manual 5.3, 5.4): a write FIFO and a read FIFO, EACH 8 WORDS (16 bytes).
// Commands and their parameters go in through the write FIFO; RPR/RPTN/RD results come
// back through the read FIFO. The status bits are the flow control a driver polls:
//   WFE  write FIFO empty (safe to write up to 8 words)     WFR  not full (1 word ok)
//   RFR  read FIFO has a word                               RFF  read FIFO full
//   CED  the chip can take a NEW command (cleared when one is written, set when it ends)
//   CER  an undefined command or a bad parameter; cleared only by ABT
//   ARD  a drawing crossed the defined area (AREA modes); cleared by RPR or ABT
// RES* and ABT (CCR bit 15) both put SR at $23 = CED|WFR|WFE with both FIFOs cleared.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// COORDINATES AND THE FRAME MEMORY (manual 5.10, 6.6-6.8, ORG)
//
// The frame memory is sequential 16-bit words. A logical pixel of bpp bits lives in one
// word at DOT ADDRESS d, occupying bits [d*bpp .. d*bpp+bpp-1] -- pixel 0 is the LOW
// bits (manual ORG-3: "bit position 4-7 at word $25" is DPD=4 at 4 bpp). X increases
// through the dot addresses of a word and then into the next word; a raster is MW words
// wide (the screen's Memory Width register), and +Y is the raster ABOVE, i.e. MW words
// LOWER in memory -- ORG sets the origin's physical word address and the axes point
// right and UP from it. Scan-out reads rasters from the Start Address upward in memory,
// so the top raster on the screen is the lowest address.
//
// WHICH PIXEL IS LEFTMOST is not the chip's decision: it puts a word on its MAD bus and
// the BOARD's shift register serializes it. For the drawing engine's +X to be "to the
// right", the board must shift the LOW dot address out first, and that is the only
// wiring under which the ACRTC's own manual examples make sense; scanline() assumes it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT IS MODELED, AND WHAT IS NOT (docs/boards/cadzilla.md has the honest list)
//
//   Register file: all of it, with the auto-increment rule.       FIFOs and SR: all.
//   Commands: ORG WPR RPR WPTN RPTN / RD WT MOD DRD DWT DMOD CLR SCLR CPY SCPY / AMOVE RMOVE
//             ALINE RLINE ARCT RRCT APLL RPLL APLG RPLG CRCL ELPS AARC RARC AEARC REARC
//             AFRCT RFRCT PAINT DOT PTN AGCPY RGCPY, with every
//             OPM, every COL and every AREA mode, the pattern pointer and its zoom
//             counters stepping live (RPR reads them back); CRCL ELPS AARC RARC AEARC
//             REARC traced pixel by pixel in their C direction; PAINT as a scan-line
//             seed fill with no stack limit; PTN in all sixteen SL/SD directions; AGCPY
//             RGCPY with every S/DSD rotation and mirror. Every opcode is executed; an
//             undefined one sets CER.
//   Reads:    a read that does not fit the read FIFO waits for room, and the command
//             stream waits behind it (manual RD-1).
//   Scan-out: the three background screens (upper/base/lower) stacked by SP0/SP1/SP2 and
//             the window over them, graphic screens only, non-interlaced, GAI +1/+2/+4/+8.
//   Timing:   TWO MODES, the board's choice (setTimed). UNTIMED (the default): drawing is
//             instantaneous at the moment the last parameter lands -- WFE and CED are the
//             steady state and a guest that times a command sees an infinitely fast ACRTC.
//             TIMED: every command costs its datasheet Table 3 2CLK count, paid in the
//             memory cycles the display leaves free for drawing (DRAWING TIME, below);
//             until it is paid, the words behind it wait in the write FIFO and CED, the
//             SR flags it raised and any words it answers stay unseen. Either way the
//             raster counter is not modeled and DTACK/wait states do not exist.
//   Not modeled: zoom, character screens, block/graphic cursors, light pen, blink
//             attributes, DMA handshaking (DRD/DWT/DMOD run in the manual's "under
//             program control" mode), interlace, master/slave sync.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// DRAWING TIME (timed mode; datasheet Table 3, manual 2.2 and OMR ACP/RAM/ACM)
//
// The chip knows time only as a count of 2CLK cycles, which the BOARD supplies (advance):
// the board has the oscillator and knows how 2CLK relates to the CPU's T-states. The chip
// never learns what a second is.
//
// COST. Table 3 gives each command in 2CLK cycles, from its parameters and from what it
// drew: L and d are the logical pixel positions the command visited (counted in drawPixel
// -- COL-suppressed and AREA-clipped positions included, as they step the pattern too), B
// the rows of a plane command, x and y the words of a block command. P = 4 for OPM
// 000-011, 6 for 100-111. PAINT's formula is exact only for a rectangle (Table 3 note 2);
// it is applied with A x B = the pixels painted and B = the spans. The program-controlled
// transfers are charged word by word as the words move: 4 per word, 8 per row, 16 (DRD:
// 12) per started group of 8 words, and the table's constant when the command starts.
//
// WHERE IT IS PAID. A cost of N 2CLK needs ceil(N/2) drawing SLOTS; a slot is one memory
// cycle (two 2CLK). A raster is HC+1 slots from HSYNC falling, a frame VC rasters from
// VSYNC falling, and a slot is free for drawing by these rules:
//   - the last slot of HSYNC low (the attribute output cycle): never;
//   - the other HSYNC-low slots (the DRAM refresh period): only with OMR RAM = 1;
//   - the display period -- the background's HDS..HDS+HDW on a lit raster, the window's
//     HWS..HWS+HWW on a window raster: none in single access with ACP = 0 (display
//     priority), all with ACP = 1, and every second slot (the drawing phase) in the dual
//     access modes;
//   - every other slot of the retrace: always.
// A chip that is not started (OMR STR = 0), or whose HC/VC describe no frame, has every
// slot free. The frame's phase is simply 2CLK time / 2 modulo the frame, from power-on.
// ASSUMPTIONS the manual does not settle: Table 3's counts are what the drawing processor
// takes when it gets every slot it asks for; in the dual modes the retrace slots are all
// free, as in single access; a command's end is fixed when it starts, so a timing
// register written while it runs moves the NEXT command, not this one.
